# Nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem (NIEP) spectra checker

The goal with project is to provide a flexible framework for checking whether a given spectra is the spectra for a nonnegative matrix. To do this known necessary conditions will be added and the spectra will be checked against all of them.
